# Source Code for Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning Models

This repository contains the source code used in the study for building and evaluating various deep learning models for stock price prediction. 

## Getting Started
You can use this code to reproduce the results, delve deeper into the model configurations, or use it as a foundation for your own experiments.


## Installation

The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file which lists the Python packages necessary for running the code. To install these packages, use the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

The code can be run sequentially with the provided shell script (`run.sh`). You can execute this script by running:

```
./run.sh
```

This command will first execute `create_training_data.py` to create the training data, followed by `train.py` to train the models.
